        PLAYER CONSENT AGREEMENT<br><br>
  
        By proceeding beyond this point, you, the Player, voluntarily and knowingly agree to partake in the interactive operation known as the *Mechanis Obscura Directive* (hereinafter referred to as M.O.D.). Participation in M.O.D. involves exposure to experimental stimuli designed to destabilize perceptual boundaries and may induce acute psychological stress, altered states of consciousness, and derealization.<br><br>
  
        You acknowledge that M.O.D. may result in—but is not limited to—the following outcomes: disorientation, nausea, hallucinations, involuntary memory resurfacing, identity confusion, partial sensory deprivation, brain fatigue, cognitive looping, spiritual displacement, trauma regression, seizure, and in rare but documented cases, permanent neurological disruption or death.<br><br>
  
        By continuing, you release M.O.D. and all its affiliated agents, constructs, and creators from any and all liability. You affirm that you are of sound mind, over the legal age of consent in your jurisdiction, and solely responsible for any consequences resulting from your engagement.<br><br>
  
        If at any point you wish to withdraw consent, you may do so by terminating all interaction with the system. Note: withdrawal does not guarantee safety, nor will it erase what has been seen or experienced.<br><br>
  
        Should you not accept these terms, you are advised to close this page immediately. Proceeding will serve as your digital signature of consent.<br><br>
