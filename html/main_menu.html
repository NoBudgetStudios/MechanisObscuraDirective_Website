      You are now an active Player in the Mechanis Obscura Directive — an immersive and highly thematic system of puzzles and cognitive trials. Your task is simple in design, yet formidable in execution: solve as many challenges as you can.<br><br>

      For optimal performance and full functionality, Players are strongly advised to engage with the system using a desktop or laptop computer. Mobile devices may limit visibility, interaction, or access to critical elements.<br><br>

      Each puzzle within this Directive is uniquely crafted to test different faculties — logic, perception, creative insight, and in certain cases, technical understanding. These trials are not bound to uniform difficulty. Some may unfold easily. Others will resist until your thinking adapts beyond convention.<br><br>
    
      Every puzzle has only one true resolution: a 4-digit code. When extracted, this code signifies completion. It is your responsibility to document each code. The system does not preserve your progress, nor will it offer reminders.<br><br>
    
      This is not a game of speed — but of depth, clarity, and resilience. Proceed with precision. Record with care. And above all, think beyond the frame.<br><br>      
      
      We see the fracture in you. We will fix you.<br><br>
