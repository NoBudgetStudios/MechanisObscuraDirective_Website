    <div class="text">

    <p>You are a wanderer across a world unknown, seeking fragments of a truth long buried in silence.</p>

    <div class="hidden-text">The first is double the second.</div>

    <p>The only item in your inventory is a timeworn book, its pages frayed, its cover faded, yet within it lie secrets in plain sight and paths toward the knowledge you seek.</p>

    <div class="hidden-text">The third is the first minus one.</div>

    <p>Surrounded by vast, untamed nature, you begin to sense a quiet order in the chaos, the trees, the winds, the stones, all part of a single breath.</p>

    <div class="hidden-text">The fourth is the sum of the first and second.</div>

    <p>Each clue touches the next, shaping and reshaping meaning like rivers carving into earth.</p>

    <div class="hidden-text">The second is odd.</div>

    <p>Opening your book, you discover its strange geometry, LETTERS RISE LIKE PEAKS, WORDS STRETCH INTO MOUNTAINS, AND WHOLE SENTENCES FORM RANGES touched first by morning light.</p>

    <div class="hidden-text">All are different.</div>

    <p>But not all light reveals, TRUTH OFTEN LINGERS IN THE SHADOWED VALLEYS, where few dare to look.</p>

    <div class="hidden-text">None is zero.</div>

    <p>Only those who SEARCH THE EDGES, where darkness folds around the forgotten, are worthy to find what waits in silence.</p>
